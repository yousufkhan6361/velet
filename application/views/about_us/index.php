    <p>Thank you for visiting The Northern Ireland Connection</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Here is a little bit about who we are and why we decided to create The Northern Ireland Connection</p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>I am originally from Canada and when I first moved here, I found it difficult to find the businesses/services I needed.  My husband is from here and didn’t need to search for businesses the same way I did. I also couldn’t always rely on him for recommendations. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Most of the business directories I found were mostly focused on tourist information or they covered all of the UK plus Ireland.  I wanted a place where I could find a dentist, hairdresser, mechanic etc. just in Northern Ireland.  I also wanted to be able to favourite the businesses I liked to help narrow down my search. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>We figured even people who have lived here all their lives may have the same difficulties I had with finding the services they need.  We also saw how having videos on ads could be so beneficial, but most places that have videos there is only a link to Facebook or YouTube. Which means you would have to leave one site to view the video on another site…. From that The Northern Ireland Connection was born!</p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>We wanted a site where the person looking for a service isn’t forced to sign up to look, doesn’t have to pay to get a phone number or the link to a website. We wanted a site that was clutter free of google ads and popups.  Businesses do not have to pay a referral fee when someone wants their details.  There are no hidden costs. All the businesses details are there in their ad page. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>We also wanted a platform where not just larger businesses but smaller and new entrepreneurs can market their services, product or business.
 </p>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>The feature I like the most is the Favourites!  I know when I was looking for a hairdresser and I was searching Google and Facebook I would have loved the ability to just click a button and all my favourites appeared!  (I stole this feature from Airbnb maybe other sites use it too, but Airbnb is the first that comes to mind)
 </p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>We hope you like the site and we would love your feedback!  We are very customer focused and want this site to be the go-to whether you are looking for a service or a Business looking to reach a wider audience.
